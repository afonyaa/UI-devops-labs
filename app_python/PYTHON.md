# General suggestions I found out by experience with python

## Code formatting and linting
- I did not follow any configurable linter configurable plugins, but I found out that there are a lot of  modern IDE'S
that helps to solve this. As for more comprehensive libraries and plugins which I found, there is PyLint and Fake8
- It is also good to use any prettier tools, especially running them on pre-commits hooks, and avoiding to push the code 
if it is not well formatted

## Best practices
- I did not meet with any testing libraries for python, but due to the reason that it is not static-typed language,
so I suppose that there are some tools and practices which helps to control the typing in python's programs
- It is recommended to test any component and interface of system
- Keeping list of dependencies in `requirements.txt file`
- Use gitignore
- Use yaml file for configurations

## Why Python
- I don't know, I hate it :/
## Why Flask
- Scalable, flexible and light-weight
